# sql-Oracle-logAmount

Each of the script needs to be run as SYSDBA. If you run is as a normal Oracle database user this script will fail. 

# Shellvariable

If you set the Shell variable $SQLPATH to a certain location where you have stored all your SQL files you don't need to for execution the entire path.
I like to create the directory ~/sql and store the login.sql file plus all the helpful tool scripts
